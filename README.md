Users can sign in with their accounts or sign in with Google.

If they don't have an account, they can sign up

## Map View

Once signed in, users are directed to the map view. Using Google Maps Platform API, we've created a mapview that shows all available events. There is also a navigation bar (a.k.a. the "nav bar") on the bottom, with the map view as the first button on the left.

## Events management

Navigating to the second button on the left on the nav bar, we have your events management page. Here you can see events you're hosting and events you've requested to join. Below each event you're hosting, others users requesting to join can be accepted or denied.

## Event creation

At the heart of our app (literally in the center of the nav bar) is event creation! Events can be created here by specifying fields such as a name, location, category of activity, and more. All requested fields must be completed for an event to be registered. Registered events show up on the map with an icon specified by the category chosen at the specified location. Events spanning multiple locations are not yet supported, but a possible workaround is to simply make multiple events.

## Profile View
Each user has an individualized profile that they first setup when signing up. If you signed up with Google, your google image will be imported as your profile image. Any socials that you link to our app will also be available to view by other users.

## Friends
From the profile view, your friends list can be accessed. There are to expandable dropdowns, "friend requests" and "friends". In the friend requests dropdown, friend requests from other users can be accepted or rejected by clicking the green check or red x, respectively. The friends dropdown will show all your accepted friends.

## Edit profile 
From the profile view, you can also click the "edit profile" button. This will bring you to a page where you can make changes to your own profile.
